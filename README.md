Marine Mammal Detection Probability Modelling (MMDPM) is a standalone graphical user interface coded on MATLAB which allows the user to estimate a detection probability. It uses state of the art propagation model BELLHOP to simulate the propagation of a specie-specific cue around the detector. The bathymetry for the area of interest is automatically retrieved from GEBCO-2021 global grid and ocean properties are queried from Copernicus online models to derive sound absorption coefficient based on the deployment period and position of the mooring. The app allows users to specify environment parameters such as seabed characteristics, marine mammalsâ€™ signals properties (i.e. source level, frequency, bandwidth) and the ambient noise, which can be derived directly within the app, either from an input sound file or from Wenz model. All these parameters are then combined to estimate a detection probability map.
